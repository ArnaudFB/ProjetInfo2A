Projet Informatique 2A ENSAI (Sujet 8 : Velib' Hunter)

# Purpose
This application is meant to offer several functionalities to their users in order to manage their access to the Velib' system database.

- For a regular user, he can find the nearest station with available bikes with functionality-1 by entering his position - a position that could be written as a usual address instead of geographic coordinates thanks to the use of Etalab API ;
- For a statistical purpose, the Velib' system managers could get access to the least-frequented station on a specific period of time he enters in functionality-2 ;
- They could also get access the least-frequented Paris borough on a specific period of time he enters in functionality-3.

We must notice that thanks to WebSocket connection, all of these functionalities are real-time updated.
